      <h2>Why</h2>
      <p>Typically every year in the last decade, the City of Toronto manages over 900,000 tonnes of waste. this requires money, energy and space in our community (City of Toronto). 

        We asked Toronto if the citys garbage sorting system is effective and efficient and only 18% agreed. 
        <br>
        There can be immense brand and marketing value in creating and maintaining positive public relations.

      <h2>Approach</h2>
      <p>Net.Gre approach is to develop a new solid waste and recycable sorting system and renewable energy infrastructure to allow the garbage to be efficiently sorted for inceneration & ready for contact with waste to energy technologies.
        <br>
        net.Green is a industry 4.0 facillity built around a network of connected devices to capture raw data within the infrastructure .

      <p><strong>MIT- Converting trash into fuel</strong></p>
      <br>
      <img src="/images/MIT.jpg" alt="MIT">
      <br>
      <p>The MIT trash system uses a multiple high-temperature processes by subjecting garbage to plasma arcs to break down organic materials into syngas, a mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide.</p>
      <br>  
      <p>Syngas can either be directly burned in gas turbines to produce electricity, or it can be converted into other fuels, including gasoline and ethanol.</p>
      <br>  
      <p>Metals and other inorganic materials in garbage can be isolated and recycled. The combination of high temperatures and an oxygen-poor environment that prevents the garbage from catching fire eliminates the production of dioxins and furans, two toxic chemicals produced during incineration.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Therefore, waste is turned into fuel</p>

     <H2>Hehagon Smart Factory</H2>
     <img src="./images/Hexagon2.jpg" alt="Smart factory image">
     <p>An important element of a ‘smart factory’ is
      Connected Devices. Everyone has heard of the
      ‘Internet of Things’ (IoT) when it comes to
      consumer devices like thermostats, light bulbs,
      and smart refrigerators in our homes. But this
      concept also makes sense for our customers like
      you as you seek to use advanced new
      technology to connect all of your devices in your
      factory so that you can monitor and control them
      remotely, and, by looking at production data and
      sensor trends even predict when the machines
      will need servicing.</p>

      <p>Another promising technology under the ‘smart factory’ umbrella is Artificial Intelligence (AI) – sometimes called machine learning (ML). It's now possible to use the advanced mathematical techniques of AI/ML to analyze the massive amounts of data that you have collected over time in order to gain some insight, make some predictions, and potentially even take direct autonomous action without human intervention.</p>

      <p>These industry 4.0 solutions implemented in a waste management facility can be extreamly impactful in the communities long run. It will allow a connected ecosystem of 
        smart devices that will allow the facility's internal and external elements to operate at maximum efficiency while keeping sustainability a top priority.
