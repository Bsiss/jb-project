      <h2>Why</h2>
      <p>Net.Green is a industry 4.0 facillity built around a net- work of connected devices to capture and send raw data within the infrastructure to improve waste man- agement operations and effieincy. Net.Geen facility runs on local renewable energy.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Our digitized soultions create factory automation that lead to a more cost effective and efficient process with the use of AI, sensors, data, cloud computing, and autonomous technology. Net.Greens’s top priority is sustainablilty, this approach of optimizing a waste management facility will have a smaller environmen- tal footprint then the conventional process.</p>

      <p><strong>Hexagon Smart Factory</strong></p>
      <br>
      <img src="./images/Hexagon.jpg" alt="renewable icon" width="564em" height="364">
      <br>
      <p>HxGN smart factory's offer solutions to digitalized factories to gen- erate and share data from every point in the products manufacturing life-cycle. Connected manufacturing can generate real time data, move that data from where its created to where it needs to be used to create value(efficiency, minimize waste, automation patterns, machine learning, AI). </p> 
      <br>
      <p> harvested data can be used to develop a unique autonomous connected ecosys- tem (smart factory). Hexa- gon develops software and hardware products that support design, engineering, simulation, production, in- spection, and data asset management allowing for optimization of infrastruc- ture.</p>
      <br> 
      <p>An important element of a ‘smart factory’ is
        Connected Devices. Everyone has heard of the
        ‘Internet of Things’ (IoT) when it comes to
        consumer devices like thermostats, light bulbs,
        and smart refrigerators in our homes. But this
        concept also makes sense for our customers like
        you as you seek to use advanced new
        technology to connect all of your devices in your
        factory so that you can monitor and control them
        remotely, and, by looking at production data and
        sensor trends even predict when the machines
        will need servicing.</p>
        <p>Another promising technology under the ‘smart factory’ umbrella is Artificial Intelligence (AI) – sometimes called machine learning (ML). It's now possible to use the advanced mathematical techniques of AI/ML to analyze the massive amounts of data that you have collected over time in order to gain some insight, make some predictions, and potentially even take direct autonomous action without human intervention.</p>
        <br>
      <p>These industry 4.0 solutions implemented in a waste management facility can be extreamly impactful in the communities long run. It will allow a connected ecosystem of 
        smart devices that will allow the facility's internal and external elements to operate at maximum efficiency while keeping sustainability a top priority.
